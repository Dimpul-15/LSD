LSD (LUMPY SKIN DISEASE) PREDICTION
The project aims to address the significant challenges posed by Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) 
in the context of cattle farming. LSD poses a severe threat to both the health of individual 
animals and the overall livelihood of cattle farmers. The primary consequence of the 
disease is a substantial decrease in milk production, which can lead to food shortages and 
disrupt the broader food chain. Cattle farmers heavily depend on their livestock for their 
livelihood, making the early detection of LSD crucial for preventing outbreaks and 
minimizing the economic and ecological impact.
